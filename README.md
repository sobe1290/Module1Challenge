# Module1Challenge
Module 1 challenge submission

This is a mock webpage for an assignment for coding bootcamp. Its purpose was to take an existing web page and refactor the code so that is is accessible and SEO optimized.

The code was refactored by:
  Changing HTML elements to be semantic.
  Fixing broken segments of HTML, such as internal page links that did not work.
  Brought the hero image out of CSS and into HTML for SEO optimization and accessibility.
  Elmiinating uneccessary lines of code in the CSS by grouping children of elements together.
  The CSS code commented to describe each part.
  
  Below is a screenshot of the page.
